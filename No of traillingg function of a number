//Mr. Bean is very good in mathematics. He was given a number n and was told to find out number of trailing zeroes in n! (Factorial) . Can you help him?

package com.company;

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Trail {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x,fact=1;
        Scanner s=new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Enter the number");
        x=s.nextInt();
        int temp=x;
        int z=0;
        while(temp>0)
        {
            fact=fact*temp;
            temp--;
        }
        while(fact>0)
        {
            if(fact%10==0)
            {
                z=z+1;
            }
            if(fact%10!=0)
            {
                break;
            }
            fact=fact/10;
        }
        System.out.println("Total no. of trailing zeroes in factorial of "+x+" are "+z);
    }
}
